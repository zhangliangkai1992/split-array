split array[n] into m part with balance
strategy:
	calc the average on m:
		sum = array[0] + ... + array[n-1];
		average = sum / average;
	sort array in ascend
	scanning the sorted array from end to begin:
		every vector of parts[0], parts[1], ... parts[m-1] have a sum
		if(partSum[currentVector] + array[i] <= average)
			parts[currentVector].push_back(array[i]);
		else
			break for loop;
		from 0 to index(where jump out of loop)
			parts[currentVector].push_back(array[i]);
